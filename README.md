This repository contains all of my final ICS4U projects, which were essentially assignments that needed to be completed for marks.

Here you will find elements of:
- Recursion
- GUI, Encryption and User Friendly Interface
- Animation in GUI
- One-Way Encryption
- Implementation of Arrays, Methods and Classes
- Object Orientated Programming

  These assignments are all implementations of lessons that were taught in ICS4U.
